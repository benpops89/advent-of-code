# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles created by Eric Wastl's. I am using Python to solve the challenges as this is langauge I am most comfortable with. I may look to use other langauages in the future.
